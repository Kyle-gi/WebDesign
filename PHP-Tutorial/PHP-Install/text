Well as I know that these files are not going to work in visual studio
I know that if you want to see your result of PHP, you need to save your file in hotdocs
What I mean is that you need to follow these steps before you start php

There are two ways.
install php server, or install xampp
what I did was installing xampp
after installing xampp you need to start Mysql and Apache
then after you started it you are able to save your php document in C:\xampp\hotdocs\Yourfile.php

There you have it.
